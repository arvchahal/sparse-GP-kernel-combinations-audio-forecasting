# Kernel Combinations in Sparse Gaussian Processes for Time Series Forecasting

## Data: TBD

# TODO:
- update with all kernels we aim to implement
- verify all kernels work on simple 2d
- verify it works on data similar to the problem we have 
- test on our own problem data
- determine what tests/experiments we will run (3 or 4) and what we will report
- clean up code
